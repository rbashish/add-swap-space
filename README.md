# add-swap-space
A Python package to add swap space to a Linux system


### This package provides a command-line interface to add swap space to a Linux system.
#### It prompts the user for the desired swap size in GB and then adds the swap space using the dd and mkswap commands. After the swap space has been added, it updates /etc/fstab to make the swap permanent.
